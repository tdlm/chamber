# The Chamber

## Introduction (a)

You wake up in absolute darkness, not knowing who or where you are. There's the sound of trickling water nearby. Speaking out, you hear only echoes; you're alone. Feeling around on your body reveals a single item: a lighter. You struggle with it a bit, but eventually it takes light. The tiny bit of light feels blinding at first, but your eyes adjust. You look around and find you're in a cave. Worse, there are no doors. This is an enclosed chamber and there doesn't seem to be a way out.

## Discovery (b)

After your initial wave of panic washes over you, you decide to take a better look around. You find a seemingly useless pile of electronics, and a rock hammer. Grabbing the rock hammer, you do what any prisoner in your situation would do: you start to dig.

## Mining

Mining will yield elements. Different tools allow you to reach certain elements. For instance, _Rock Hammer I_ will only get you _Coal_ or _Rock_. _Rock Hammer II_ and _Rock Hammer III_ will have a higher chance, respectively, of yielding coal than rock. The _Steel Picks_ will yield _Iron_ and _Thorium_. The _Diamond Picks_ will yield Lightium and Brightium. There is a small chance of attaining special items.

## Robots

All that mining is hard work! Why not put your robots to work for you? That useless pile of electronics? As it turns out, it contains a series of _Thorium Reactor Cores_ which take _Thorium_ as a fuel source. After that, you find you have a stunning ability to piece electronics together. In no time at all, you've got robots digging for you.

## Monsters and Beasts

While digging, there is a chance you'll run into trouble. This is a cave after all, and who knows what lurks in the darkness? Of course, you'll arm yourself against any potential trouble, or risk death! Careful,
