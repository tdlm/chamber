# The Chamber
=======

## Introduction (a)

You wake up in absolute darkness, not knowing who or where you are. There's the sound of trickling water nearby. Speaking out, you hear only echoes; you're alone. Feeling around on your body reveals a single item: a lighter. You struggle with it a bit, but eventually it takes light. The tiny bit of light feels blinding at first, but your eyes adjust. You look around and find you're in a cave. Worse, there are no doors. This is an enclosed chamber and there doesn't seem to be a way out.

## Discovery (b)

After your initial wave of panic washes over you, you decide to take a better look around. You find a seemingly useless pile of electronics, and a rock hammer. Grabbing the rock hammer, you do what any prisoner in your situation would do: you start to dig.
